Decoherence Modeling of a Controlled-Z Quantum Gate under Strong Magnetic FieldsAbstract/OverviewThis project investigates the decoherence behavior of a Controlled-Z (CZ) quantum gate in semiconductor quantum dots, particularly under the influence of strong magnetic fields. It leverages spin-boson and Zeeman dynamics to model the interactions and evaluate the gate's coherence properties under realistic conditions.Key Features/ContributionsQuantum Gate Simulation: Simulated the evolution of a Controlled-Z (CZ) gate using both QuTiP (for Hamiltonian-driven dynamics) and Qiskit (for gate-level abstraction).Decoherence Analysis: Performed a comparative analysis of key metrics, including state probabilities, purity, and fidelity, in the presence and absence of a 5 Tesla magnetic field.Magnetic Field Impact: Demonstrated that strong magnetic fields accelerate decoherence by introducing significant dephasing, leading to a notable decline in quantum state purity and fidelity over time.Theoretical Modeling: Incorporated theoretical models to describe phonon-induced decoherence, charge noise suppression, and spin relaxation mechanisms within the quantum system.MethodologyThe study employed a simulation-based theoretical approach:QuTiP: Used for master equation evolution to model the physical decoherence, including magnetic-field-dependent Zeeman splitting and collapse operators tied to phase damping.Qiskit: Utilized for gate-level abstraction, incorporating Kraus and thermal noise models to analyze logic fidelity.Parameters: Simulations were run with parameters such as omega=1.0, V=0.2, Omega=0.2, and a magnetic field B=5TËœ.ResultsThe simulations revealed that the inclusion of a strong magnetic field (5T) significantly increases decoherence, leading to a sharp decline in both purity and fidelity over time compared to the no-magnetic-field scenario. This indicates a substantial loss of quantum coherence and highlights the detrimental effect of such fields on qubit integrity in CZ gate operations under the simulated conditions.VisualizationsThe plots/ directory contains detailed graphs illustrating:State Probabilities Over Time (CZ Gate)Purity Over TimeFidelity to Initial State Over TimeExample:Technologies UsedPythonQuTiPQiskitNumPyMatplotlibInstallation/UsageTo run the simulation scripts:Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Quantum-CZ-Gate-Decoherence-Modeling.git
